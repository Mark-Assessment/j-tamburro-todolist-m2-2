## Testing User Stories 
### User Experience (UX)

**I would like to be able to have a simple application that allows me to add a list of tasks that I would like to complete.
- The user is presented with a simple, clear and easy to navigate To-Do List application.

![To-Do List Application]()
I would like to be able to check the tasks off as they are completed.
I would like to be able to edit tasks, so that I can change the wording.
I would like to be able to delete tasks and for an alert to pop up incase the delete button is clicked accidentally.
I would like to be able to store my list so that when the webpage is reloaded, I can still see my completed and/or outstanding tasks.
