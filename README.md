# To-Do List

You can visit the live site [here](https://jtam90.github.io/todolist/).

For my Milestone Project 2 in L5 Web Application Development, I have designed and created a To-Do List. This has been created with the intention of users being able to add a list of tasks with the ability of checking them off, editing them, deleting them and storing them. This website has been developed in such a way that it is very simple to use, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

# User Experience - UX

## User Stories
-- As a User...
- I would like to be able to have a simple application that allows me to add a list of tasks that I would like to complete.
- I would like to be able to check the tasks off as they are completed.
- I would like to be able to edit tasks, so that I can change the wording.
- I would like to be able to delete tasks and for an alert to pop up incase the delete button is clicked accidentally.
- I would like to be able to store my list so that when the webpage is reloaded, I can still see my completed and/or outstanding tasks.
