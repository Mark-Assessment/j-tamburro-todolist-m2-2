# To-Do List

You can visit the live site [here](https://jtam90.github.io/todolist/).

For my Milestone Project 2 in L5 Web Application Development, I have designed and created a To-Do List. This has been created with the intention of users being able to add a list of tasks with the ability of checking them off, editing them, deleting them and storing them. This website has been developed in such a way that it is very simple to use, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

# User Experience - UX

## User Stories
As a User...
- I would like to be able to have a simple application that allows me to add a list of tasks that I would like to complete.
- I would like to be able to check the tasks off as they are completed.
- I would like to be able to edit tasks, so that I can change the wording.
- I would like to be able to delete tasks and for an alert to pop up incase the delete button is clicked accidentally.
- I would like to be able to store my list so that when the webpage is reloaded, I can still see my completed and/or outstanding tasks.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

Below represents the different colours used in this project:

- ![#5F9EA0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5F9EA0/000000?text=+) `#5F9EA0`
- ![#0b5e60](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0b5e60/000000?text=+) `#0b5e60`
- ![#ddede8](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ddede8/000000?text=+) `#ddede8`
- ![#f9f9f9](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f9f9f9/000000?text=+) `#f9f9f9`

I chose these colours as they complement each other well and co-ordinate nicely with the background image. I also thought the colours worked well for a To-Do List, as they are not distracting and instead have quite a calming effect.

## Typography

  I have used the font "Alegreya Sans" as the font throughout the site, with a fall back font of "sans-serif" for easy readability and simplicity. I have used <a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> for this.

  ## Imagery

  I have used just one image for this site, which is used as the background image. I chose this image because it is simple and does not distract the user. Plants are known for their soothing and relaxing effects on the mind, which complement the use of a To-Do List nicely.

  ## Input Field

  The input field has a placeholder text of "Add a new task...". This enables the user to type in their desired task.

  ## Add Task Button

  The "Add Task" button is located under the input field, in the centre. This enables the user to trigger the action of their task being added to a list by either clicking the button, or hitting the enter/return key on their keyboard. The colour of the "Add Task" button changes to a darker shade when it is hovered over.
  Depending on whether it is displayed on a mobile device or whether it is displayed on a tablet/desktop device, it shows up differently.

  ## Task List

  The task list enables the user to have a list of tasks they would like to complete. It includes their added tasks, as well as a checkbox, an edit button and a delete button. 
  Depending on whether it is displayed on a mobile device or whether it is displayed on a tablet/desktop device, it shows up differently.

  ## Checkbox

  The checkbox can be clicked by the user if they have completed the task. Upon clicking the checkbox, the task font will have a strikethrough text decoration for easy readability and user experience.

  ## Edit Button

  The edit button allows the user to edit the task. The colour of the edit icon button changes to a darker shade when it is hovered over. Once in edit mode, there is a "save" icon button to enable the user to save their newly edited task.
